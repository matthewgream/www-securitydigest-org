Subject: Risks in a public database

At least a hundred criminal defense lawyers across Maryland are legally
soliciting new clients by notifying people wanted by the police, sometimes
tipping off suspects before officers have had a chance to arrest them.  In
Maryland, arrest warrants are public records when issued.  The lawyers pay
LETS Co. in Edgewater MD to search those records, generating mailing lists,
and sending letters to the defendants.  In some cases, suspects have been
tipped off before they could be arrested.  [Source: Philip P. Pan and

Subject: Risks of bundling in Microsoft Internet Explorer

The online press has been reporting an unexpected risk of bundled MS
Internet Explorer.  Some programs automatically install MS IE 3.0 during
installation -- and a few don't provide a way for the user to prevent this
installation.  If MS IE 4.0 is already installed, the resulting mess leaves
neither 3.0 nor 4.0 in a runnable state.

I've also heard rumors that installing (at least one version of) MS IE will
remove competing browsers from the registry.  This is easier to fix than
mismatched MSIE DLLs, but few people would understand why installing one
program (e.g., Quicken was listed) would result in their preferred browser
becoming unusable or deregistered.

Finally, such bundling disregards the fact that some of us actually prefer
the earlier releases of the browers.  My copy of Netscape (2.02) may not
have all of the latest bells & whistles, but on the other hand it doesn't
have all of the latest bells & whistles.  If it meets my needs, why would I
want to load a larger, slower program which includes "features" I'll never
use, such as "push channels."

Some Quebec restaurateurs have been using a U.S.-made computer program (a
"zapper") that skimmed off up to 30% of the receipts, thereby evading
Revenue Canada and provincial government tax payments (millions of dollars
estimated for the latter).  [Source: Timothy Appleby, Rhe'al Se'guin and

Subject: Lufthansa combats mobile phone Risk

A Reuters article today describes a new effort by Lufthansa to identify
dangerous in-flight use of mobile telephones.  They are testing a hand-held
passive sensing device which detects mobile phone signals and helps the
operator locate the offender.  The article goes on to mention that beyond
the safety factor, using mobile phones in flight is illegal in Germany
(along with use of CD players or laptops with CD-ROM drives or printers).

What actually drew my attention to the article was its poorly-chosen title
-- "Lufthansa to snoop on airborne phone users".  The device is clearly
neither able nor intended to "snoop".  Considering the idiocy of using a
device that can directly cause the death of you and several hundred people
around you, it occurs to me that the detector can double as an in-flight IQ
test...

Subject: GSM hack -- operator flunks the challenge

On Friday 13th September 1996, I read in comp.risks that:

> MobilCom, a subsidiary of German TeleKom (since 100 years monopolist on
> telephone communication in Germany, with its monopoly ending in 1998)
> publicly offers 100,000 DM to a telephone hacker who is able to communicate

This caught our attention - Cambridge University, being a registered
charity, surely qualifies as a `social institution', and 100,000 DM would
buy us a state-of-the-art triple-wavelength laser microprobe workstation for
chipcard breaking. So we had a look at GSM and found a way to hack it. We
worked out what equipment we'd need and where we could borrow it, assembled
the team, checked that the attack would work in principle, and then started
trying to find the right person in Deutsche Telekom to speak to. We needed
to know the IMSI (international mobile subscriber identification) and get
written confirmation of the challenge; otherwise the attack might have been
interpreted as an offence under Britain's Wireless Telegraphy Act.

After some chasing around, unanswered e-mails and so on, we went to a mobile
phone fraud conference in June and made contacts there which suggested some
names, leading to further unanswered correspondence, and finally a faxed
reply.  Here is a translation of the original German, online at
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/ftp/users/rja14/roesner.gif>:

   Dear Dr Anderson

   Many thanks for your fax of the 6th October 1997. Please 
   excuse the late reply to your fax.  The matter that you mentioned did not
   originate from T-Mobil but from one of our service providers, the firm
   Mobilcom in Schleswig.  We understand that the offer has since also been
   withdrawn by them.  Yours etc.

How does our attack work? Well, when a GSM phone is turned on, its identity
(the IMSI) is relayed to the authentication centre of the company that
issued it, and this centre sends back to the base station a set of five
`triples'. Each triple consists of a random challenge, a response that the
handset must return to authenticate itself, and a content key for encrypting
subsequent traffic between the mobile and the base station. The base station
then relays the random challenge to the handset. The SIMcard which
personalises the handset holds a secret issued by the authentication centre,
and it computes both the response and the content key from the random
challenge using this secret.

The vulnerability we planned to exploit is that, although there is provision
in the standard for encrypting the traffic between the base station and the
authentication centre, in practice operators leave the transmissions in
clear. This is supposedly `for simplicity' (but see below).

To break GSM, we transmit the target IMSI from a handset and intercept the
five triples as they come back on the microwave link to the base
station. Now we can give the correct response to the authentication
challenge, and encrypt the traffic with the correct key. We can do this
online with a smartcard emulator hooked up through a PC to a microwave
protocol analyser; in a less sophisticated implementation, you could load
the handset offline with the responses and content keys corresponding to
challenges 2 through 5 which will be used on the next four occasions that
you call.

The necessary microwave test set costs about $20,000 to buy, but could be
home built: it's more than an undergraduate project but much less than a
PhD, and any 23cm radio ham should be able to put one together.  We would
have borrowed this, and reckoned on at most 3 person months for SIM-handset
protocol implementation, system integration, debugging and operational
testing.

Given such an apparatus, you can charge calls to essentially any GSM phone
whose IMSI you know. IMSIs can be harvested by eavesdropping, both passive
and active; `IMSI-catchers' are commercially available.

The fix for our attack is to turn on traffic encryption between the GSM base
stations. But that will not be politically acceptable, since the spooks
listen to GSM traffic by monitoring the microwave links between base
stations: these links contain not only clear keys but also clear telephony
traffic. Such monitoring was reported in the UK press last year, and now the
necessary equipment is advertised openly on the net. See for example
<http://www.gcomtech.com/>.

The RISK for intelligence agencies? Making systems like GSM give government
access to keys can have horrendous side effects (especially where this
access is via channels that aren't properly documented and evaluated). These
side effects can get you into serious conflict with powerful commercial
interests.

The RISKS for phone companies? Firstly, letting spook agencies bully you
into a bad security design with the assurance that it will only compromise
your customers' privacy, has as a likely side-effect the compromise of your
signalling and thus your revenue. (David Wagner, Bruce Schneier and John
Kelsey made this point for the US cellular system: see
<http://www.counterpane.com/cmea.html>.)

Secondly, most phone companies have no crypto expertise. Their security
managers are largely ex-policemen or accountants, and so are unable to
evaluate the security claims made by equipment manufacturers and
intelligence agency representatives.

Thirdly, by restricting parts of the security specification to people who
signed a non-disclosure agreement, the GSM consortium deprived itself of the
benefit of open scrutiny by the research community.  It is this scrutiny
that has led to protocols such as SSL and SET having their holes found and
fixed. However, the global deployment of GSM ensured that many people would
be cleared to know the design, most of which can be got anyway by observing
traffic or by reverse engineering unprotected equipment. So public scrutiny
was inevitable - but only after billions of dollars' worth of equipment had
been deployed and the system could not changed. So the GSM
security-by-obscurity strategy gave them the worst of all possible
worlds. The consumer electronics industry should take note.

The specific RISK for Deutsche Telekom: responding to cynicism about GSM
security claims by putting up a reckless challenge and thus motivating an
attack.

The RISK for GSM users: that crooks running a call-sell operation will book
a very expensive phone call on your account. An established modus operandi
is to set up a conference call which their clients and counterparties join
in succession. As the bill isn't forwarded to the service provider until the
phone goes on-hook, you can end up with a five-figure bill for a call that
lasted several days and involved hundreds of overseas telephone
numbers. Some GSM operators (such as Vodafone) limit this exposure by
terminating all calls after six hours; but your IMSI can be used on a
network that doesn't do this.

And of course, as with `phantom withdrawals' from cash machines, the use of
cryptography will `prove' that you're liable for the bill.

Subject: Bug threatens Net software: land.c

Somebody has released a program, known as land.c or Land Attack, which can
be used to launch denial of service attacks against various TCP
implementations.  The program sends a TCP SYN packet (a connection
initiation), giving the target host's address as both source and
destination, and using the same port on the target host as both source and
destination.  Vulnerable systems include Windows NT, some versions of SunOs,
Cisco routers and Catalyst software.  [Source: Bug threatens Net software,

  Mixed messages.  Is the interpretation to be, if you hack, you'll get off?
Or if you hack some other country's computers, you won't be prosecuted
because it costs too much?  Of if your partner in crime gets off with just a
fine, prosecutors won't spend a lot of money going after you?
  So Bevan *may* have hacked into computers worldwide.  But he has no

Subject: Date-based random numbers and Y2K

I had a friend report to me a problem with the game Freecell on his PC.  
Ordinarily, Freecell starts a different numbered game each time a new game 
is started.  However, his copy was stuck on #3389.

It turns out that his system date had been accidentally changed to 2097 
rather than 1997.  Correcting the date fixed the problem.

This made me think about how many programs use time/date-based random 
number generators.  You would not expect Freecell to have a date-based bug, 
but it does.  I suspect there are a lot of other programs with the same 
bug.  Although they may not necessarily fail at 1/1/2000, they may fail at 
some other point.  (Where a computed value exceeds 16 bits, for instance.)

There are a lot of programs that obviously use dates, but I'm afraid we're 
going to find a lot of others that seemingly don't fail due to date-based 
problems too.

Subject: Re: Y2K and canned-goods expiration dates (Pereira, Risks-19.47)

There is, of course, a different and much simpler Y2K problem that also
affects expiry dates, though it's unlikely to pertain to canned goods.
If you see an expiry date of APR01, say, then it's useless unless you
correctly understand whether the product is one likely to last for
several years or not.  Otherwise -- well, is that next (or perhaps
*last*) April 1, or is it April of 2001?

(People who would write the former as "01 APR" are probably laughing at
this point, but they need only think about the confusions when April
is converted to 04 instead, and a common standard is not followed...)

I've been pleased to see a number of long-lived products these days using
4-digit years in their expiry dates, but as Fernando's story shows, there
are still plenty that don't.

In a(n otherwise somewhat contentious) bill, the Government of Ontario has
removed the ``personal information'' of students from the control of the

This would be merely annoying, until one finds out the definition of

        Two implementers (HP/Verifone and IBM) have provided their own set

        interoperable.

        set 0.0 use has been extended three months to avoid a christmas
        season work conflict in migrating to set 1.0.

        Set providers acknowledge its three tiered architecture is complex.
        These are the client wallet, the merchant server and the banks
        gateway.  These use software from multiple vendors. The set process
        will be dependent on millions of certificates from merchants and

        The bank industry must resolve the operational issues to tie together

        issuing/using millions of certificates.

Picture this: you are standing in front of a classroom full of students

to use a service that lets you perform searches a huge library database
containing alle the books in Norwegian college libraries.  Your PC is hooked
up with a video canon that projects a LARGE image of what's on your screen
on the wall.

You bring up the web page of the service you are about to demonstrate.  The
page loads, the graphics for the various buttons in the interface is
loading...but something is wrong.  One of the buttons is not a button at
all.  It's a large, particularly nasty, pornographic image which was
definitely NOT put there by the providers said service.

This happened earlier this week at a Norwegian college where a friend
of mine works as a system administrator.

Now, how did this happen?

Well, like every responsible institution on the net they have a local web
cache in order to speed things up and save bandwidth.  this cache sometimes
forwards request to yet another cache, and it was this cache that caused the
embarrassing incident.

It turns out the second cache was out of disk space and somehow this
messed up the mappings between URLs and the actual images stored in
the disk cache, so every now and then the cache would serve the wrong
file from the cache.  several people could confirm this behaviour.
