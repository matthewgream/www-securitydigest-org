Subject: Serious security flaw in Microsoft Java

Karsten Sohr at the University of Marburg has discovered another serious
security flaw in Microsoft's Java Virtual Machine.  A bug in Microsoft's
bytecode verifier allows the construction of code sequences that illegally
cast values of one Java type to values of another unrelated type, in
violation of Java's typing rules, without detection by Microsoft's verifier.
A malicious applet can exploit this flaw to breach the JVM's security, and
can then proceed to do anything it wants to do on the victim's computer.
For example, a malicious applet might exploit this flaw to read private
data, modify or delete files, or eavesdrop on the user's activities.

Dirk Balfanz and I, at Princeton University, have constructed a
demonstration applet that exploits this flaw to delete a file.

All recent versions of Microsoft's JVM for Windows appear to be vulnerable,
so users of recent versions of Internet Explorer are affected by this flaw.
A malicious applet could also be embedded in an e-mail message read using
Microsoft Outlook or Eudora.  Users of other JVMs, browsers, and email
readers are generally not affected.  (Thanks to Reliable Software
Technologies for their help in testing on various platforms.)

We have reported this flaw to Microsoft and they are working to address it.

For more information, contact Karsten Sohr (sohr@mathematik.uni-marburg.de) 
or Edward Felten (felten@cs.princeton.edu, phone (609) 258-5906).

Subject: Latest British train collision

The latest head-on collision occurred at the same Signal 109 near Ladbroke
Grove in Western London as the collision that occurred two years ago (almost
to the day).  The previous accident occurred when one driver was looking
downward and somehow missed two Red signals.  The latest accident was also
attributed to a driver missing a Red signal, this time the driver of a
commuter train that crashed with a high-speed intercity train from
Cheltenham.  The train had an Automatic Train Protection System, but it was
switched off because it was ``not operational''.  Its operation might have
helped, although it reportedly would not by itself have prevented the
accident.  A new Train Protection Warning System had been scheduled to be
installed at Signal 109 in December 2003, along with many other places.
[Source: *The New York Times*, 9 Oct 1999, which noted at least 70 deaths
and 64 people unaccounted for.]

  [Owen Hopkins noted that 8 trains have run past this signal in the past 
  6 years.  Signal 63 has an even worse record.  Comments also from 
  Jonathan Pritchard...  With the breaking up of British Rail, there is no
  one organization left to rail at?  PGN]

     [CORRECTION: My statement that the previous accident involved the
     same signal is INCORRECT.  It will be corrected in the next issue. PGN]

Subject: TCAS unit flaw

There's a fascinating article in the 12 Oct 1999 *Wall Street Journal* about
how a flaw in a TCAS (Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System) nearly
caused a crash, rather than preventing one.

On 28 Jun 1999, a British Airways jet and a Korean Air jet nearly collided
when the latter's TCAS unit told the pilot to climb.  The Korean Air plane
was 2000 feet below the British Airways plane; however, the pilot was told
that it was in fact 400 feet *above* it.  That's too close, so the pilot was
advised to climb.  And that, of course, almost induced a collision.

Part of the problem was with a circuit that sends the plane's altitude to
the TCAS system and to the transponder.  The circuit uses an 11-bit code
over a parallel connection; a single-bit error, which occured in testing,
would correspond to a 2400 foot difference in altitude -- precisely the
error here.  (The article also notes that on a previous flight, the crew of
this plane was advised that their transponder was giving the wrong
altitude.)

The British Airways jet, though, had a TCAS system that noticed an
instantaneous jump in the altitude of the other plane.  Since that's
impossible, the bad readings were properly ignored, which in turn meant that
there was no warning to the crew.  When the TCAS system finally did detect
that the other plane was climbing towards it, it could only say tell the
pilots to dive, since the other plane was climbing.  But that, according to
the article, was precisely the wrong thing to do.

The Korean Airways jet's TCAS system does include a comparator circuit to
verify the altitude reading.  Due to a wiring problem, however, that circuit
was silently disabled; there is no warning to either pilots or mechanics of
this condition.  And the faulty altitude reading occurred when engineers
left the air-data computer "on for a long time and added extra electrical
power".

The article closes by noting that the only thing that saved the two planes
was marginally inaccurate navigation, and that if GPS-based systems were in
use, the planes would have collided head-on.

at the California Highway Patrol's San Diego communication center started
receiving cellular 911 calls from Nevada, with callers reporting accidents

Subject: Calif government computers fail, cars impounded, ...

Massive computer crashes have repeatedly forced California agencies to turn
away customers for driver's licenses, food vouchers and other services.  The
Highway Patrol suddenly had difficulty checking criminal records.  Child
Protective Services could not get quick access to abuse files.  For two days
Glendale's DMV office had to process driver's license renewals manually. And
one consulting firm clocked 19,000 minutes of intermittent outages in the
first half of 1999.  Some cars were impounded because computer records
incorrectly showed licenses had expired.  The Women, Infants and Children
program reported a severe drop in participation, and had to return $5.7
million in unspent Federal funds.  There were lots of long lines.  [Source:

Space Station Immune to Metric Mishap, NASA Says
By Daniel Sorid, 05 Oct 1999

  The International Space Station will not fall victim to the measurement
  units problems which ruined the Mars Climate Orbiter, according to a NASA
  spokesman.  In the early 90s, engineers put together a so-called interface
  control document, which identifies the use of metric or English units for
  every piece in the station, according to NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown.
  "This is not a new issue for us," Brown said. "It's so well documented
  that we don't have that problem."  The document also shows where metric
  and non-metric units interact with each other, and calls for the
  development of adapters that standardize the units.  "Engineers got
  together and said, 'Here's the piece of hardware. Let's see where they
  interconnect.'  If we've got a metric piece and an English piece, that
  will show up very clearly in the document."  [...]

There's one little problem with this theory: Mars Climate Orbiter had an
interface control document too.  (JPL is ISO9000 certified!  We have
documents for everything.)  It was obviously not enough to save MCO; why
should it be any different for ISS?

Most accounts in the press make the MCO disaster sound like a massive
breakdown in communications, with one group of people doing everything in
Metric and another doing everything in English units, and no one talking to
anyone else for months on end.  I was told this morning by a member of the
MCO team that this is not true.  Everyone knew that everything was supposed
to be Metric across the board.  The problem was a single number in the
software that was accidentally entered incorrectly.  The exact same thing
has happened on at least one previous mission, but the problem was caught
before it became a news story (that is, before we drove the spacecraft into
a planet.)

Regular readers of RISKS will no doubt be shocked -- shocked! -- by these
revelations.

  [I noted in RISKS-20.58 that my Maryland course on survivable systems
  had survivability problems in the second and third lectures (lightning and
  Floyd, respectively.  Here is an update.  For the fourth lecture (I was at
  SRI), the students in the classroom had intermittent video failures,
  attributed to ISDN lines still being flaky after the hurricane.  For the
  fifth lecture, the classroom had audio only.  The problem was eventually
  traced to the aftermath of the lightning strike three weeks earlier: the
  PC reboot had not included some updates for the video configuration.  
  Mercifully, the sixth lecture was uneventful.  So, only two of the six
  lectures failed to exhibit self-referential survivability problems.  PGN]

Subject: Re: Internet Explorer 5.0 flaws (Risks 20.61)

Steve Wildstrom points out (in Risks 20.61), that ActiveX has been a thorn
in Microsoft's side, which is certainly true.  He seems to suggest, however,
that *all* of Microsoft's problems boil down to problems in ActiveX, which
is *not* true.

Together with colleagues at Princeton and Xerox PARC, we recently found a
bug in Microsoft's Java VM (see Risks 20.55) that would let an attacker
compromise the VM, irrespective of the target's ActiveX settings.
Historically, it seems bugs have been found throughout Microsoft's systems,
ranging from TCP/IP fragment reassembly (e.g., "the ping of death") through
Microsoft's Web services, such as the recent HotMail privacy incident.

While I would certainly enjoy seeing Microsoft reinvent their ActiveX
architecture in favor of something that provided reasonable security
guarantees (and, heaven forbid, portability across operating systems), that
would only be the first step on the road ahead for Microsoft.

Subject: GPS rollover *did* cause DoD Problems

Mike Martin reported on the problems with Tokyo taxicabs caused by the
August GPS rollover (Risks-20.55). Aviation Week reports (Oct 4, p32)
that US DoD systems also had problemswith weapons systems, even though the
situation had been anticipated. "...the fault lay in the way the Pentagon's
two primary mission planning systems, the Air Force Mission Support System
AFMSS) and the Navy's Tactical Aircraft Mission Planning System, were
providing the data to weapons systems." 

The mission planning tools provide, amongst other things, the approximate
location of the GPS satellites to a weapons system GPS receiver so that the
receiver can  avoid large-sweep searching for the satellites.
Some receivers work with 16-bit week data; the satellites and 
mission planners rolled over; and the different formats caused
"conflicting data sets" and thus problems, according to AvWeek.

"Short-term fixes...include editing the missions planning data manually,
having the receivers find the satellites unaided or downloading the
almanac data directly from the satellite, which takes about 13 min.
The likely long-term fix is a software modification to AFMSS and TAMPS,
which is considered cheaper than modifying weapons systems hardware."

Subject: "Self-destructing e-mail"

Intrigued by the headline "'Self-destruct' e-mail offers virtual privacy"
(http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/review/crg441.htm), I did some more
investigating.  Disappearing Inc. (http://www.disappearing.com/) has few
technical details on its web site, but the general idea is that by using
their plug-in two people can send and receive encrypted messages with the
added feature that the key is held by Disappearing Inc.  Anytime the
recipient wishes to read the message, they must authenticate themselves to
Disappearing Inc. in order to retrieve the key.  Disappearing Inc. logs all
accesses to the key and destroys the key at the end of its life span.
Disappearing Inc. claims that once the key is destroyed the message can
never be read again, and thus the message has effectively self-destructed
like a Mission:Impossible assignment.

While it is possible (although sadly, unlikely) that Disappearing Inc.  has
implemented this system using an appropriate mix of good authentication
scheme, strong encryption algorithm, secure key generation, high level of
site security, and secure key transmission it doesn't really matter.  All
Disappearing Inc. offers is a variant of third party key escrow and nothing
more.  The problems with key escrow have been well documented.

By forcing users to go across the network to retrieve a key (which may have
already expired) every time they want to read a locally stored message, it
is a certainty that users will instead simply cut and paste any message
worth reading again into a plaintext file outside the control of
Disappearing Inc.'s encryption.  The potential problems with this scheme are
too many to list here, and my opinion is that users should cut out the
middle man and use a package like PGP instead.

while it was open could subsequently discover the combination and open it in
a few minutes.  Feynman identified this security risk and informed the
people in charge... who responded by ordering all people with such cabinets

Subject: Risks of screen saver messages

France Info radio reported today (1999-10-06) that an investigation into
police racism has been started in a small French town after a citizen,
visiting the police station, observed a slogan with racist overtones
scrolling across the screen of a PC on a desk in the reception area.

The officer responsible for the PC claimed that the reference to "melons" (a
French racist term of abuse, but also a legitimate word for the round fruit
which has the same name in English) referred to his daughter's passion for
harvesting said fruit.

Regardless of the plausibility or otherwise of that statement, the RISK is
clear: your screen saver message, scrolling away in bright mauve 24 point
type, and quite possibly the only thing moving to catch people's attention,
might say more about you than, say, a poster inside your locker ever could...
