> fact, GAO has found computer security problems at other agencies, such as
> State Dept, but it appears no agency has completely and this thoroughly
> cut off its Internet connection and email services.)

> Bliley planned a hearing today (2/17) on EPA computer security and had
> asked GAO to testify.  EPA raised concerns about holding the hearing.
> Reportedly, Bliley gave EPA an ultimatum: shut down the EPA web site and
> all email services or the public would hear about how to hack the EPA web
> site.  EPA decided to shut down their Internet services last night.

> Bliley postponed the hearing but called a press conference at 1 p.m. on
> Friday.  At the press conference, Bliley released the GAO testimony and

> disappointed that it had to shut down.

> According to folks in the White House, EPA is quickly trying to put the
> public web site back up and sever its connection to the internal systems.

Subject: Online prankster distorts Clinton chat

In what was billed as the first live online interview with a sitting U.S.
president, CNN's chat with President Clinton turned kinky when a computer
security consultant assumed Clinton's identity and changed his response to:
"Personally, I would like to see more porn on the Internet." The consultant
said guessing the president's nickname was an "easy trick," and that "I hope
this harmless prank has served to let CNN know that this system is insecure
and needs to be overhauled before someone does actual harm to them or one of
their guests." Such security flaws can easily sabotage New Media journalism
if not fixed, he added.  [CBC News 16 Feb 2000

CNET reported that H&R Block's online tax-filing service exposed at least 50
customers' sensitive financial records to other customers over the weekend
of 12-13 Feb, prompting the company to shut down the system on 15 Feb.
Web-based registered users signing on were given access to someone else's

"Do-it-yourself" Net filing service had to be shut down.  [Source: Courtney

Subject: Great West gives out too much personal info

I recently changed jobs and moved, so I called my previous employer to give
them my new address.  They said they would also tell Great West (401K
company; 'individual retirement plan' to people outside the US) about the
change of address.

Yesterday I got snail mail from Great West; a confirmation of my account
imploring me to examine the information carefully and report any errors to
them.  I guess this is their odd 'change of address' confirmation.

Unfortunately the mail they sent me contains: my name, birthdate, social
security number (SSN), sex, marital status, account number, the mutual funds
to which I have made contributions - and the percentages of the
contributions.

I called the 800 number to complain about their appalling lack of security
for personal information and was greeted by a telephone system which said I
could gain online access by pressing '2' - which I did.  I was then asked to
enter my SSN, which I did - and was then told that a PIN would be mailed to
me.  I wasn't required to confirm anything (not that it would have mattered,
because I had all the confirmation information right at my fingertips).
Following this, as most automated systems do, it hung up on me.

I then called back and got to speak with a customer service representative;
I briefly told him why I was calling and then he had the audacity to tell me
he wanted to confirm some information - my name, birthdate and SSN!

I was able to talk with the account representative for the company where I
previously worked and she didn't seem to see the gravity of the situation,
so I eventually got to speak with her boss, Nancy Lynch.

Nancy seemed more appreciative of my concerns and said she would bring this
up in a meeting scheduled for 2000.02.21 and call me back.  From what I
gather, no one at this company has even thought about these issues before -
which scares the hell out of me when I think about the amount of money they
must be maintaining.  I was assured that online access to my account would
not allow any transfers out of the account, but heck... who needs online
access when Great West will gladly send the key (i.e. all the confirmation
information) to the intruder's mailbox!  If I maliciously changed someone
else's address, I could gain access to their account through the phone
system and presumably cash out their account without them even knowing it.

I wonder what other privacy gems are lurking out their with financial
companies!

From: "Jeremy Epstein" <jepstein@webmethods.com>
Subject: YAIESB: Yet Another Internet Explorer Security Bug

Under certain circumstances, a web server can force an IE client to serve up
the contents of a file on a local hard drive.  The server needs to
know/guess the name of the file to be retrieved.  The vulnerability only
exists if you have Active Scripting available for the security zone (yet
another reason to turn it off!)

MS says "The vulnerability exists because it is possible, under very
specific conditions, to violate IE’s cross-domain security model in order to
allow a web site to read data that it should be prevented from reading."

An interesting feature is that if you try to install the patch on a machine
running IE 4.01 with SP1, the install states that the patch isn't needed
(when in fact it really is).  The only solution is to "upgrade" to a newer
version of IE.  Although MS warns of this on their web page, I wonder how
many people will get a false sense of security when told they don't need the
security patch.

I heard more than one reader pronounce "DoS" to rhyme with "sauce" -- and
sound just like "DOS".  I can only imagine the confusion that this caused
with listeners.

The risk?  One might argue this shows a lack of technical education in the
media.  But an equally strong argument can be made that the fault lies with
the composers of the news releases, for not explaining the jargon -- or
maybe even for not realizing that this is jargon, and not common knowledge.

Subject: Win 2000 63,000 Bugs 

And there's always the other side [Re: ZDNet comment in RISKS-20.79]:

> An Open Letter to Microsoft Customers on Windows 2000
> From: Jim Allchin, Group Vice President, Platforms Group, Microsoft Corporation

You may have seen reports in the media claiming that Windows 2000 contains
over 63,000 defects. I'd like to assure our customers that these reports are
inaccurate. Microsoft is committed to delivering high quality products, and
we believe Windows 2000 is the most reliable operating system Microsoft has
ever shipped.

In fact, the technical press, industry analysts, and our customers have
already spoken.

  a.. There have been more than 20 technical reviews of Windows 2000,
and in all of them Windows 2000 received very high marks in the area
of reliability. 
  b.. Analyst studies show Windows 2000 to be significantly more
reliable than any previous version of Windows ever.  
  c.. To ensure we received the maximum testing coverage possible
before releasing we shipped over 750,000 beta test copies of Windows
2000.  
  d.. Many small businesses like CenterBeam and WFofR as well as
hundreds of enterprises such as Ford, Wells Fargo, Motorola, and
Prudential are currently rolling out Windows 2000 across their
infrastructure.  
  e.. Windows 2000 has now been fully deployed in many businesses
including Stride Rite and Sears Homelife.  
  f.. Additionally, Windows 2000 is driving many of the world's major
websites, including Buy.com, Barnesandnoble.com, Dell.com,
Microsoft.com, Monster.com and large ISPs such as DataReturn, and
Digex.

So does Windows 2000 have 63,000 defects?  The answer is a flat no.  There
was an internal development paper that described a broad set of focus areas
for the team that mentioned the 63,000 number.  However, without
understanding our development process (which isn't described in this paper)
reporting such a number is totally meaningless when taken out of context.

First, we track many issues internally in our "bug" database, including
feature requests that someone may have mentioned or dreamed about,
potentially confusing phrases in the documentation, performance improvement
ideas, etc. - most of which are clearly not bugs in the classical sense.  We
track virtually everything mentioned by testers (internally or externally).
These include feature requests, potential problems, or real problems.  We
also track any place in our code where we think we can improve an algorithm.
This does NOT mean that there is a bug.  In fact, it is often the case the
code is marked so that it can be reviewed in the future for performance or
feature enhancements.

We also have a special advanced source code analyzer that we use.  This tool
generates a significant number of false positives (it thinks the code should
be changed, but in fact it should not be).  But, we track them all.  The
only way to be sure is to look at each hit and see if the issue is real or
not.  We love this tool.  It helps us improve our code for readability and
it can find bugs that our testing may not find.  We also track our test
code.  There are over 10 million lines of test code that can also have
improvements, potential bugs, etc. that we track in the same database.  So,
we track together test code, shipping code, and future code for the next
release (we always have future projects cranking out code long before the
previous release ships).  Technically, we keep all of this information in a
single tracking system and simply query for the kinds of information we
want.  At the end of every release we need to clean up our database and code
since it ends up accumulating lots of random data.  The internal paper
discussed doing this clean up.

Will customers run into bugs in Windows 2000?  We worked harder than ever to
ensure they would not.  Windows 2000 is the highest quality product we have
ever released-just ask any one of the thousands of satisfied users who have
experienced Windows 2000 so far.

We are very proud of Windows 2000's quality and our relentless pursuit of
the highest quality software in the world.

Thank You,

%T   "Virtual Private Networking: A View From the Trenches"

The aim of the authors is to make this book different from others in the
Virtual Private Network (VPN) field.  In this they have, to a certain
extent, succeeded.  The book does not merely rehash old approaches,
analogies, and illustrations.  While this determined novelty does not always
work, and sometimes gives the book a ragged feel, there is a freshness to it
that is engaging.  Perlmutter and Zarkower also wanted to make the book fun:
they don't always succeed, although their humour remains light throughout,
and never descends into the heavy sarcasm that befalls most who insist on
larding their books with jokes.  The levity is amusing, but it isn't really
illustrative.

The text also aims at a rather unique audience.  As well as presenting the
concepts to business people needing a basic understanding, the material
emphasizes the ability of the Internet Service Provider (ISP), and
particularly the small one, to offer VPN technology as a value added
service.  This means that the book looks at both sides of the picture, and
the view thus generated is both interesting and useful.

Chapter one offers a good introduction to the basic concepts.  The evolution
of networking adds a depth of understanding to this prelude in chapter two.
(I would note that the authors suggest cable modems and Digital Subscriber
Line [DSL] technologies can be used in conjunction with VPNs in order to
create a high speed connection between offices.  It should be pointed out
that both cable systems and the most common form of DSL have an inherent
asymmetry of bandwidth that prevents this usage.)  The business case for
VPNs is made carefully and realistically in chapter three.  Tunneling is
discussed in chapter four, although some ends are left loose.  An example of
a problem with encapsulating Appletalk over PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling
Protocol) seems to beg the question of whether the application can be made
to work.  Chapter five is not simply a list of available products, but an
outline of the types of VPN components and devices that can be used.
Considerations to be made when choosing, and getting ready for, a VPN are
brought forward in chapter six, while the ways that ISPs can offer service
are examined in chapter seven.  Chapter sight closes off with a realistic
look at new technologies that will soon be affecting VPN decisions.

Within the book there are a number of boxed items.  These are variously
scenarios, sidebars, comments, or other material entirely, and it isn't
always clear which they are intended to be.  Many of the scenarios are
extremely short, and really don't explain anything.  These materials should
not necessarily have been excluded, but more thought could have been given
to their purpose, and whether or not they fulfilled it.

This is a practical and realistic guide to the reasons for, and construction
of, a Virtual Private Network.  Users (and particularly small to medium
business users) and ISPs alike will benefit from the explanations herein.

Organized by the CERT* Coordination Center, Software Engineering Institute
General Chair:  Tom Longstaff, Technical Manager of R&D at the CERT/CC

ISW 2000 is the third in an ongoing series of IEEE-sponsored research
workshops in survivability.  The Information Survivability Workshops provide
a forum for researchers, practitioners, and sponsors to discuss the area of
survivability, the nature of the unique (and sometimes not-so-unique)
problems associated with survivability, and promising approaches to finding
solutions to these problems.

An emerging discipline, survivability extends the goals of traditional
computer security to encompass concepts, methodologies, and tools that
support the ability of a system to continue to fulfill its mission in the
presence of attacks, accidents, and failures.  The goal is not only to
thwart attackers whenever possible, but also to build systems that are
robust in the presence of attacks that cannot be completely repelled.  [...]

The ISW 2000 call for papers will be distributed, within the next few weeks,
to the same mailing lists as this announcement.  The call for papers will
also be posted at the ISW web site:
