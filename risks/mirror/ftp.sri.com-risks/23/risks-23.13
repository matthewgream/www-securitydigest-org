Subject: Is the F-35 fighter jet is too reliant on foreign software

Defense: The House Government Reform Committee expects to hold hearings this
year to determine whether the Lockheed Martin-made F-35 fighter jet is too
reliant on foreign software, Defense Daily reported Thursday. The concern,
according to a congressional source, is that the fighter, which has been
hailed as a model for international cooperation, could require foreign
software for integral parts of the aircraft's computer system. The
<http://www.gao.gov/>General Accounting Office (GAO) is preparing a report
on the issue and expects to brief committee members in about three to four
weeks, the source added. The National Security, Emerging Threats and
International Relations Subcommittee, chaired by Christopher Shays, R-Conn.,
frequently holds hearings on the status of such weapons-acquisition
programs. The subcommittee's decision to look at the software issue is part
of a broader concern about foreign software development and what effect that
could have on the availability or security of the software.

Subject: Some rental cars keep tabs on drivers (via Dave Farber's IP)

Byungsoo Son (from Georgetown, Ontario) rented a car at a Payless Car Rental
outlet in California for 12 days, with a contract rate of $259.51.  When he
returned the car, he was charged $3,405.05 and given a map showing his
actual itinerary, tracked by GPS (including Las Vegas Nevada and the Grand
Canyon in Arizona).  He was charged $1 for each mile driven outside of
California -- in violation of his contract, whose stipulated the car must
remain in California.  [Source: Christopher Elliott, *The New York Times*,

Subject: Israeli Post Office break-in

My summary/article on what happened is at
  www.math.org.il/post-office.rtf

  [Thanks to Tom Van Vleck for alerting me to Gadi's article.  A wireless
  gateway was surreptitiously installed in a computer rack in a Haifa branch
  of the Israeli Post Office (which also serves as a bank), perhaps allowing
  sniffing of passwords and other access.  The perpetrators then remotely
  accessed the system to transfer money to newly opened accounts.  The
  computer heist reportedly netted 56,000 shekels (USD$13,000) in the few
  days it was in operation.  Although withdrawals from the new accounts
  reportedly caused the perpetrators to be apprehended, Gadi speculates that
  with a little more care, the fraud could have gone undetected for much
  longer.  PGN-ed]

Subject: Online poll rigging

The Senate Republican Conference has a Web poll on its front page about the
capture of Saddam Hussein.  Apparently the results weren't turning out the
way they like (what a surprise for a Web poll!), so they changed the form to
switch the way two answers are recorded.  Now if you choose the 1st choice,
it's recorded as the 2nd, and vice versa.  But there's no feedback to let you
know it's happening.  The change has been confirmed by checking Google's
cache of the page.  Here's the story:
  http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004_01_11_atrios_archive.html#107414565730750569

If politicians are willing to tamper with something as insignificant as a
Web poll, how much more tempting is it to tamper with the results of a real
election?

Yesterday morning, Mr. Frank, who is now a senior, learned from N.Y.U. that

Subject: Some .mil and .gov subscribers of Risks Spammed

It was just recently brought to my attention that over the last week readers
of RISKS with e-mail addresses in the .mil and .gov domains have been
getting spam that was sent to risks-mil@pica.army.mil.  That address was set
up years ago to help Peter manage the huge RISKS e-mail list.  As a favour
to Peter, I managed all .mil and .gov e-mail addresses for most of the
1990s.  As part of the Risks Distribution he would send mail to
risks-mil@pica.army.mil, which then resent the mail to over 500 .mil/.gov
subscribers.  The risks-mil address was hidden so that people would not send
to it.  Last year I stopped the exploder list and all e-mail addresses from
that list were forwarded to Peter to be included in his master list (with
risks-mil@pica.army.mil being deleted from the master list).  However I
never got around to disabling the risks-mil@pica.army.mil address.  Thus
spammers were able to exploit this oversight via risks-mil@pica.army.mil.  I
have now taken steps to solve that problem by disabling the address.  Yet
another risk of not cleaning up things.

Subject: Errant weather alert

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63858-2004Jan7.html  

01/07/04: The National Weather Service's Office of Science and Technology in
Silver Spring sent a test weather-alarm message on Wednesday afternoon.
Intended for internal use only, it was instead sent via the Internet around
the world.  The alarm forecast a blizzard in the Washington DC area.

  "We thought all of the systems that were capable of going live out of this
  other facility where they do development had been disconnected, so that
  this could not happen again," Travers said. "Well, I guess they found out
  that something had not been disconnected."

[It gets better.]

Other weather-related services using the NWS feed contributed to the false
alarm by re-sending it to their customers, some of whom use proprietary
desktop weather clients like Weatherbug and Accuweather.

  Jack Hayes, director of the Office of Science and Technology, said bogus
  messages have snuck out before. His office wrestles with the challenge of
  getting weather hazard information out as quickly as possible.  Any human
  who had looked out the window would have known this warning was a
  mistake. But humans can gum up the works when trying to issue lifesaving
  alerts.  "Any time you have a human [in the process], you introduce a
  delay in getting an important warning out to the public," Hayes said.

Subject: Moscow ML fails because of time overflow bug

HOL, a system for proving theorems in Higher Order Logic,
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/
is implemented in Moscow ML, an implementation of Standard ML.
  http://www.dina.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html
For soundness, HOL records the time along with new types or theories
(collections of theorems, types, values, etc.)  which are created.  When
time values overflowed on Saturday 10 January in a few libraries of the
underlying Moscow ML 2.00, HOL was rendered unusable.

Moscow ML represents time as seconds since midnight 1 January 1970.  After
10 January the number of seconds exceeded 2^30.  Although this was
anticipated and most code for time handled this, a few libraries did not.
  http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/mosml/y2004bug.html

Maintainers issued a patch for HOL and fixes for Moscow ML within days.

Paul Eggert ends his piece with a thought that a lot of applications will
break in 2038. I think that the problem will appear much sooner than that,
as some software (reservation systems, timetabling, and so on) looks into
the future.

I hope that the time_t wraparound will be a thing of the past by 2010, but
I also hope that some legacy systems from "way back" will still be
running. These systems, maybe embedded, might just fail once and carry on,
or they might be useless as they interface with the real world and their
dates will be 2^32 seconds out.

My shop uses an old version of the Heimdal implementation of the Kerberos
authentication system (supplied with NetBSD 1.5), and we found
that after the Unix time_t "birthday", our Kerberos clients were issuing
erroneous requests.  The result was that many of our staffers coming in to
work on Monday morning couldn't log in to their workstations.

It's moments like this that make me appreciate the necessity of diverse
software implementations - since we had other versions of Kerberos available
(i.e. MIT Kerberos and a newer version of Heimdal with the bug fixed), all
of which worked, we were able to quickly identify the buggy client program.

Except that it *does* have consumer accounts, it is just that eligibility is

When I clicked on the link, I got to a form which requested a number of
personal data, including my credit card number, its security code and its
PIN code! I have put up a copy of the form they asked me to fill in at
  http://dsv.su.se/jpalme/temp/domain-name-spam-2c.pdf

I got suspicious for several reasons:

(a) No company has ever before asked me for my credit card PIN code.

(b) This information was requested by http, not https. But with a domain
name, http://https-ebay.com which might make some people believe it was
actually using https.

(c) Looking up in whois indicates that the owner of the domain name
https-ebay.com is a private person, not a company.

To be on the safe side, I immediately blocked my credit card, since I had
entered some information before I understood this was a spoof. I also wrote
to PayPal, who confirmed that the mail was not from them!

I have learnt to be more careful and suspicious in the future!

 The RISKS Forum is a MODERATED digest.  Its Usenet equivalent is comp.risks.
=> SUBSCRIPTIONS: PLEASE read RISKS as a newsgroup (comp.risks or equivalent)
 if possible and convenient for you.  Alternatively, via majordomo,
 send e-mail requests to <risks-request@csl.sri.com> with one-line body
   subscribe [OR unsubscribe]
 which requires your ANSWERing confirmation to majordomo@CSL.sri.com .
 If Majordomo balks when you send your accept, please forward to risks.
 [If E-mail address differs from FROM:  subscribe "other-address <x@y>" ;
 this requires PGN's intervention -- but hinders spamming subscriptions, etc.]
 Lower-case only in address may get around a confirmation match glitch.
   INFO     [for unabridged version of RISKS information]
 There seems to be an occasional glitch in the confirmation process, in which
 case send mail to RISKS with a suitable SUBJECT and we'll do it manually.
   .UK users should contact <Lindsay.Marshall@newcastle.ac.uk>.
=> SPAM challenge-responses will not be honored.  Instead, use an alternative 
 address from which you NEVER send mail!
=> The INFO file (submissions, default disclaimers, archive sites,
 copyright policy, PRIVACY digests, etc.) is also obtainable from
 http://www.CSL.sri.com/risksinfo.html  ftp://www.CSL.sri.com/pub/risks.info
 The full info file will appear now and then in future issues.  *** All
 contributors are assumed to have read the full info file for guidelines. ***
=> SUBMISSIONS: to risks@CSL.sri.com with meaningful SUBJECT: line.
 *** NEW: Including the string "notsp" at the beginning or end of the subject
 *** line will be very helpful in separating real contributions from spam.
 *** This attention-string may change, so watch this space now and then.
