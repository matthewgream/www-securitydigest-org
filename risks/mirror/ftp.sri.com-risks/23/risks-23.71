Subject: Australian Frigate reversed onto rocks by computer override

Computer overrides the crew and reverses the Frigate onto rocks, a classic
risk of such automation.

http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,12204297-26618,00.html

Frigate on the rocks, By Ian McPhedran, 10 Feb 2005

The [Royal Australian] navy's newest $500 million warship was driven
backwards on to Christmas Island after crew error caused computers to take
control of the frigate.  A series of errors prompted the computer system to
over-ride manual commands and the ship's company had to stand by and watch
as HMAS Ballarat backed on to the rocky shoreline.  The 3600-tonne high-tech
Anzac class frigate, delivered last April, carries a missile-armed
helicopter and has a 127mm gun, torpedoes and missiles.

The 22 Jan incident damaged both propellers and the rudder and left
taxpayers with a bill of about $2 million and the navy with a major
headache.  The debacle began when the ship was conducting a boat transfer
during a planned U-turn manoeuvre.  It was operating in "port echo" or
economy mode at the time.

*The Daily Telegraph* has been told the move was supposed to take the
warship inside a buoy which had another ship's mooring line attached to it.
As the ship approached the buoy it became clear to the crew on the bridge
that it would not make it and would pass over the line, so they attempted to
make an urgent "three-point" turn.  This was when things started to go
seriously wrong.

Because the ship had only one of its three engines running, the crew tried
and failed to run one propeller forward and one astern to conduct the
radical turn. Such a move is impossible with just one engine running.  At
this point the control system froze, the ship's computer took over and
placed both propellers into reverse.  It shut down the engine soon
afterwards, but by that stage the ship was travelling in reverse at a couple
of knots.

  [Essentially the same article, with *The Daily Telegraph* replaced with
  *The Courier-Mail* (Brisbane) was submitted by David Tombs.  PGN]

Subject: More uses of satnav/GPS

BBC news is reporting [1] that British Rail is thinking of use sat-nav / GPS
to help keep trains running on time.

I hope they realize that GPS may be shut off by the US government during
emergencies or terrorist acts (see RISKS 23.62). Hopefully someone will at
least think about using Galileo [2] as a back up, or even better, use
inertial guidance [3] as the primary system with satellite navigation as the
backup system.

The same concerns are applicable to any transportation system (e.g., cars,
boats, airplanes).

Subject: Urology medical student residency "matching" process failure

Source: http://blogborygmi.blogspot.com/2005/01/selection-dysfunction.html

  Medical students don't just apply for residency positions at graduation --
  they "match" into them. The students rank their favorite programs, the
  hospitals rank their favorite students, and everyone hopes for the best as
  an algorithm puts them together. This process, more or less unchanged for
  decades, across many specialties, went terribly wrong last week during the
  urology match ...

Basically, they had to run the match again (with different outcomes) a few
days after announcing the first results.  This is huge in the lives of the
prospective doctors because a residency determines where you will live and
what you will do for many years.

According to the discussion boards, the AUA (American Urology Association?)
has blamed the mismatch on a misconfigured computer algorithm, which was
only discovered because some top-ranked residency programs were unfilled,
which supposedly never happens.

So, why wasn't a human reviewing the results of the match for reasonableness
before publication?  Why aren't the algorithms used in the match process
freely available?  What safeguards are there on the data-entry step (since
GIGO continues to apply)?  Why isn't there an audit process in place?

  [It could have been worse.  Suppose someone was matched who was reportedly
  an expert in Eurology (e.g., an economist in Brussels)...  PGN]

Subject: Congressman Ron Paul R-TX Understands Risks and Countermeasures

As early as RISKS-6.73, consequences of automated sharing of driver license
information have been discussed.  While the appropriateness of
countermeasures levied against risks has been a fundamental element of
RISKS since its inception, the mention in RISKS-2.20 of Mann's article
(http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200209/mann) marked the beginning of a
(still nascent) popular tendency to review countermeasures for
appropriateness, all the more so since the Patriot Act and successors.

I'm happy to learn that at least one congressman, Dr. Ron Paul, (R) TX, gets
it.  I'm unhappy that it is not one of my congressmen -- I'm from Virginia
-- but maybe mine will learn from their Texas colleague!

H.R. 418, the "Immigrants ID bill" or "REAL ID Act of 2005," is advertised
in part as establishing and rapidly implementing "regulations for State
driver's license and identification document security standards, to prevent
terrorists from abusing the asylum laws of the United States, to unify
terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility and removal."  (See
http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.00418:)

The Honorable Dr. Paul characterizes HR 418 as a National ID Card bill
masquerading as immigration reform.  The clarity and brevity of his comments
merit reading, both from an infosec perspective as well as a countermeasures
perspective (http://www.house.gov/paul/congrec/congrec2005/cr020905.htm,
excerpted and LMS-ed below:

  " ...this bill will do very little to make us more secure. It will not
  address our real vulnerabilities. It will, however, make us much less
  free. In reality, this bill is a Trojan horse. It pretends to offer
  desperately needed border control in order to stampede Americans into
  sacrificing what is uniquely American: our constitutionally protected
  liberty."

  "This bill establishes a massive, centrally-coordinated database of highly
  personal information about American citizens: at a minimum their name,
  date of birth, place of residence, Social Security number, and physical
  and possibly other characteristics ... that will be shared with Canada and
  Mexico!"

  "This legislation gives authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security to
  expand required information on drivers' licenses, potentially including
  such biometric information as retina scans, finger prints, DNA
  information, and even Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) radio tracking
  technology."

  "There are no limits on what happens to the database of sensitive
  information on Americans once it leaves the United States for Canada and
  Mexico - or perhaps other countries. Who is to stop a corrupt foreign
  government official from selling or giving this information to human
  traffickers or even terrorists? Will this uncertainty make us feel safer?"

Security practitioners know better than most the aptness of the saying, "err
in haste, repent at leisure."  I hope Representative Paul's common-sense
proves to be contagious before HR 418 comes to a floor-vote.

Subject: Flexibility destroys identity uniqueness: Implementing of IDN

It is now possible to spoof the URL displayed in the address bar, SSL
certificate, and status bar of a browser, due to the increased flexibility
brought about by the IDN (International Domain Name) implementation, which
allows using international characters in domain names.  This can be
exploited by registering domain names with international characters that
resemble commonly used characters.

See security details here: http://secunia.com/advisories/14163

  [This is another old topic in RISKS, but as Jon points out, it is

Subject: RFID Tagging Elementary School Children

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6448213/did/6942751/

The only grade school in Sutter, California is requiring students to wear
radio frequency identification badges that can track their every move. Some
parents are outraged, fearing it will rob their children of privacy.  The
badges introduced at Brittan Elementary School on 18 Jan 2005 rely on the
same radio frequency and scanner technology that companies use to track
livestock and product inventory.

While similar devices are being tested at several schools in Japan so
parents can know when their children arrive and leave, Brittan appears to be
the first U.S. school district to embrace such a monitoring system.

Civil libertarians hope to keep it that way.  [PGN-ed]

I've had the nasty experience to have lost four CD's to newer high-speed CD
and DVD-drives within a year.

The current state of technology will run CDs and DVDs at high speeds, and
the centrifugal force of the drive increases the risk of any scratch on the
media to result in one broken CD, and one ruined drive.

  [Drew Dean commented to me on this: ``I believe programs such as Exact

Subject: You type Zuerich and I type Zurich...  A brief note

There's been one of those idiosyncratic discussions in rec.arts.sf.fandom on
the details of library catalogues and author's names, and the most recent
issue of RISKS has sort of bounced off it.

Zuerich is, I understand, a quite correct "english" version of the Swiss
placename.

Most english-speakers will type "Zurich", similar to the native version but
using an ordinary ASCII "u", just as all sorts of other accent marks get
missed from European-language names.

And now Unicode allows computers to store all the variations as unique
codes, which is good for typesetting, but has potential for confusion
between visually similar characters.  Not everyone will be exploiting that
confusion for entertainment, as happened in "Monty Python and the Holy
Grail".

But will search engines and indexes get tripped up by the differences, both
correct alternatives and mistakes?  Google does suggest alternatives to some
spelling errors and variants, but how far do you go?

Just another example of the risks of Word features.  Not quite in the league

elderly people with no prior history of heart attack who use the painkiller

The writing is a bit technical, but pretty clear.

But when press release writers compose these things, they have to run a copy
past the scientist involved. His comments in the margin of the final draft
were inadvertently sent out to everyone on the mailing list.  They're meant

Versions affected include:

Eudora 6.2.0 and below

The flaws permit execution of arbitrary code via:

1) previewing or opening a specially crafted e-mail
2) opening specially crafted stationary or mailbox files

These issues have been resolved in Eudora 6.2.1 as detailed at
http://www.eudora.com/security.html

It can be downloaded from:

http://www.eudora.com/products/

NGSSoftware are going to withhold details of this flaw for three months.
Full details will be published on the 2nd of May 2005. This three month
window will allow users of Eudora the time needed to apply the patch before
the details are released to the general public. This reflects NGSSoftware's

Subject: Re: U of Calgary adding spam and spyware (Slade, RISKS-23.70)

The risk of not learning what needs to be learned!

It's about time this was done! :-)

In 1992 I found a small book in a bookstore in Saudi Arabia, that had been
published by the German "Kaos Computerclub". In this book the authors
explained how viruses worked, from an angle of approach of how to write
viruses (at that time we had to deal mostly with DOS boot sector viruses).
The authors further described how they had approached major software
companies with this information, none of whom was the least bit interested
in the information or in any cooperation with people who knew how to write
viruses. Some of the approached companies had furthermore warned the
authors against publishing the information about viruses they had on hand.

I am not impressed, to say the least, that 13 years after the Kaos
Computerclub had the right idea, in a world awash in viruses, worms, and
spam, with a world-wide deployed home computer OS that seems to have less
security than the front door of my house, we still have not made any
progress in regards to how we deal with knowledge about malware.

In the the CBC article that Rob Slade refers to, Aycock (the "virus teacher"
at UofC) is quoted as saying "[S]ome companies have said they're not going
to hire [our] graduates because they don't like the perception of having
someone on board who has written viruses."

Well, I imagine reading the following in Time Magazine: "The White House
official said, 'We are not going to hire body guards who have been trained
at school X because we don't like the perception of having someone on staff
who has been trained to kill.'" Would you forgive me for laughing?

Rob Slade further writes:
>I can vaguely see a dim advantage to having students write viruses in order
>to understand them (rather inefficiently, in terms of time spent), but
>getting them to write a spamming program in order to understand how to fight
>spam seems even less effective.

Not all approaches to learning something are equally effective, and in an
area where something is being pioneereed, the first steps may not be quite
in the right direction or not as effective as future approaches. But that
alone is not a good reason to abolish a certain curriculum. My question
would be "What would make this training more effective?"

>As previously noted, John Aycock doesn't seem to have any credentials in
>security or malware [...]

Assuming this is relevant (it may be but need not be - i would suggest that
anybody who is a well-trained programmer and has the requisite imagination
has in principle the necessary credentials) why not call for a more
qualified professor for that course, then, instead of suggesting this
training is a bad idea?

I hope one day we will see malware courses in all university computer
science programs - then i would have reason to be more optimistic that the
"security mess" we are finding ourselves in might be cleaned up.
Creativity, more than anything else, is what we need to deal with the
future, and anybody who fosters and harnesses such creativity has my vote.

Hmmmm - who does have "credentials" in these fields? Is there a "mal-ware"
certification board? I must have missed it.

I did survey Aycock's professional literature, much of which is available
on-line, and I notice that a great deal of it centers on reverse-engineering
methodology, compiler/parser theory, etc. These are in fact the tools of the

%T   "A History of Computing Technology"

Yet another timeline from the Pascaline to Babbage to ENIAC?  Not so.  How
refreshing, and fascinating, to see a history that really tells us how we
got here.

Chapter one talks about the development of numeration itself, and the
various forms of representing numbers (as well as a few systems of
calculation).  Early aids to calculation, starting with fingers and moving
through to slide rules, are described in chapter two.  Throughout the book,
Williams has included frequent references to how calculating tools and
techniques have given rise to common phrases.  The definition of "point
blank" is particularly fascinating, involving not only a particular gunnery
instrument, but also the distrust of the Arabic numeral zero, which paranoia
would have been uniquely strong at that specific time.  Mechanical
calculators are discussed in chapter three, covering much more than the
usual reference to the Pascaline.  Chapter four outlines Babbage's machine;
noting that he was more social than is usually thought, and that he
succeeded in a number of fields (inventing, for example, the cow catcher);
explains why the Difference Engine is known as such, and further mentions
that it was hardly a failure, but spawned a bit of a building spree that
lasted over twenty years.  Analog, rather than digital, computers are often
neglected, but chapter five notes a number of significant devices.  The
large mechanical or electro-mechanical machines of the 1940s are frequently
seen as the beginning of the computer revolution, so it is interesting that
the book is half complete before chapter six takes a look at the Zuse
machines, the Bell relay machines, and Aiken's line.  Chapter seven moves
into the electronic world with reviews of the Atanasoff/Berry computer,
ENIAC, and the Colossi.  Given the importance of the work at Bletchley Park
in terms of character manipulation (in cryptanalysis) it is interesting that
other forms of text manipulation technology have not been addressed up to
this point.  The early computers dealing with stored programs are reviewed
in chapter eight.  As could be expected, the development of memory
technologies is a major component of this material.  Chapter nine finishes
off with a review of some other early mainframe type computers.

We tend to pass over the history of computing with varying degrees of
interest.  Having a detailed examination of the development of both ideas
and technologies of the basics of computing is both fascinating and helpful.
Those who ignore the history of computing are likely to buy it again,
repackaged under a new name.  Professionals willing to understand the
foundations of the industry and operations of the machinery will be in a
much better position to judge what will (and what will not) be of importance
in the future.
