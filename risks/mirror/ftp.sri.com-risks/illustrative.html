<P>This list summarizes items that have appeared in the Internet Risks Forum
Digest (RISKS) - which I moderate (comp.risks newsgroup) - and/or
published ACM SIGSOFT <I>Software Engineering Notes</I> (<B>SEN</B>).  In this
collection of mostly one-liner summaries, (R i j) denotes RISKS volume i
issue j; (S vol no:page) denotes an issue of <B>SEN,</B> where there has been
one volume per year, with vol 33 being the year 2008; page numbers are given
fairly regularly from 1993 on; (SAC vol no) indicates an item in the
quarterly SIGSAC Security and Control Review, where vol 16 is 1998, which
was the final volume.  The RISKS-relevant <B>SEN</B> material prior to 1995
is summarized in my Computer-Related Risks book (see below).  <B>SEN</B>
material is now being brought on-line by Will Tracz:
<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigsoft">http://www.acm.org/sigsoft</A>
<P>Some incidents are well documented, while others need further study.  A few
are of questionable authenticity, and are noted as such ("bogus???").
Please send me corrections and new cases, along with suitable references.

"Inside Risks" distills some of the discussion into a
monthly inside-back-cover column in the <I>Communications of the ACM.</I>
The list of columns to date is given at the end of this document.
<P>My book (Peter G. Neumann, <I>Computer-Related Risks,</I> Addison-Wesley
(ISBN 0-201-55805-X) and ACM Press (ACM Order 704943), 1995) summarizes many
of these cases and provides additional analysis.  (A few errata for the
first three printings are on my Web page, noted above.)  Most of the (S vol
no) items listed below for <I>no &lt; 20</I> are discussed in the book; more recent
items generally include the relevant on-line (R i j) references.  If you
cannot find the book in a bookstore, it is on amazon.com, or call A-W within
the U.S. at 1-800-822-6339 - or if you are outside of the U.S.,
1-617-944-3770 and ask for International Orders.  The book is now also
available in Japanese (ISBN 4-89471-141-9).  Instead of trying to produce a
second edition in the face of a massive influx of new RISKS cases, the
fourth and fifth printings of the book gives the URL for the Addison-Wesley
Web site
(<A HREF="http:www.awl.com/cseng/titles/ISBN-0-201-55805-X/">http:www.awl.com/cseng/titles/ISBN-0-201-55805-X/</A>),
which includes the first chapter of the book and an extended preface.  That
Web site and my own contain further material that would otherwise have gone
into the second edition.  
<P>Henry Petroski (among others) has noted that we rarely learn from our
successes, and must learn more from our failures.  The collection of cases
cited here provides rich opportunities for reflection that could help us to
avoid similar problems in the future.  Unfortunately, it also demonstrates
that the same types of mistakes tend to recur, over and over...
<P><I>SEN</I> and RISKS also consider approaches for developing better computer
systems, e.g., safer, more reliable, more secure, fewer cost and schedule
overruns, etc.  There are many approaches to developing sound systems; none
is guaranteed.  Whereas the emphasis in the following list is on problems
rather than on would-be solutions, the pervasive nature of the problems
suggests that techniques for the effective development and operation of
computer-related systems are frequently ignored.  Worse yet, even ideal
systems can result in serious risks, through unanticipated technological
problems or human foibles.  We include here primarily cases that have been
publically reported, although we know of various additional cases whose
existence for one reason or another has not seen the light of day.  A few
successes are also included, although the failures seem to predominate.  We
are always interested in hearing more about successes.  Although I receive
occasional complaints about the preponderance of failures in RISKS, there
appear to be very few real successes.  Perhaps not enough folks are heeding
some of the advice that you can gather from RISKS and that are distilled in
<I>Computer-Related Risks.</I>
<H1><A NAME="2">Descriptor Symbols</A></H1>

    (with respect 
    to diVerse adVersities, including attacks <I>and</I> malfunctions).
    Startlingly many cases fit this category; many V-unflagged cases also
    represent failures to continue performing properly, or delays, or other
    cases of misuse that could have led to much more serious survivability 
    problems.
<P>$ = Loss of resources, primarily financial
<P>S = <B>S</B>ecurity/integrity/misuse problem;
P = <B>P</B>rivacy/rights abuse or concern

<P>e = Improper <B>E</B>volution/maintenance/upgrade. (H,h,i,f,d,e involve human foibles.)
<P>r = Problems with <B>R</B>equirements for system or
    operation (including the overall system concept)
<P>f = <B>F</B>laws (or <B>F</B>eatures in design, or hardware/software

   deadlock over whether to do a left or right roll to return to upright,
   and the software froze (S 9 5).
   This case is still one that still needs definitive
   resolution after all these years.  Either (1) this was a flaw in the 
   avionics software that was detected by the simulation, or (2) perhaps 
   it was an error in the simulation program itself rather than the 
   avionics software.  Does anyone still alive know for sure?

<H2><A NAME="25">1.22 Election Problems</A></H2>
<P>We have reported election problems in <I>Software Engineering Notes</I> and
RISKS for many years.  Many of these problems are summarized below.  More
recently, in the 2000 election, particularly in Florida, the chickens of
neglect have come home to roost, exemplifying everything we have been saying
all these many years - and more.  Similar to the 1988 fiasco where a
210,000-ballot undervote occurred in the Senate Race in four counties run by
BCR/Cronus, 19,000 votes were disqualified for the presidential race 
in Palm Beach
County, and many more in Broward County - perhaps because of the confusion
raised by the butterfly ballots.  There are also some reports of the
left-hand and right-hand pages being improperly aligned, so that a vote for
one candidate actually counted for another candidate.  Dimpled chad became
important - perhaps resulting in part from blocked and never-cleaned chad
trays (and there was a lot of extra chad resulting the invalidated multiple
votes!).  There were many irregularities involving improper voter
disenfranchisement, with at least 91,000 voters being unable to vote because
of a largely erroneous list of supposed convicted felons - including one
election commissioner who found herself incorrectly on the list, and was
apparently the only one to block use of the list in her region.
<P>Also, see the CACM Inside Risks articles from November 1990 (PGN), 1992,
1993, 2000 (Rebecca Mercuri), January 2002 (Mercuri), as well
as November 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007 (various authors).
(<A HREF="http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/insiderisks.html">http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/insiderisks.html</A>).
<P>Numerous problems are noted in the on-line RISKS, along with various
commentaries (R 21 10-14).  We note that
punched-card systems are inherently flaky (!), and that even optical
scanning is problematic, but that direct-recording electronic systems tend
to be subject to serious potentials for fraud and manipulation.  Internet
voting is a disaster waiting to happen in light of the inadequate security
of the Internet, personal computer systems, and subvertible servers.
For example, the SERVE system appears to be seriously flawed.
Proposals to vote from automated teller machines (R 21 15-16) are also
problematic, and basically undesirable.  Election 2000 demonstrated once
again that we need to reexamine the entire election process objectively, and
devise less-easily subvertible checks and balances that can provide much
greater assurance.  Election 2002 still had vastly too many problems,
many of which have not been eliminated for Election 2004.
<P>Integrity throughout the election process is essential.  And yet we
repeatedly hear about unexplained anomalies (enumerated below, including the
1985 articles by David Burnham noted below) and various suspicions of fraud
- some with convictions.  For example, Ransom Shoup II (purveyor of the
ShoupTronic election machines) was convicted of two felony counts -
election fraud and conspiracy to commit election fraud.  In 1996, Senator
Chuck Hagel was CEO of the election company (now a part of ES&amp;S) used by
most of Nebraska in his first-term election (e.g., see Thom Hartmann, If you
want to win an election, just control the voting machines, <I>The Hill</I>,
31 Jan 2003 - R 22 55); this may not have affected the outcome, but the
early denial of the association is certainly ethically curious.  In 1999, 22
people were indicted in Louisiana and 9 admitted guilt in a huge
bribery/kickback election scam involving the acquisition of Sequoia voting
systems.

CES systems were open to fraud; California and Florida also investigated;
Michael Shamos quoted - CES systems equipment "is a security nightmare

Some thoughts on the November 2004 U.S. election process: almost everything
  in the election process was a potential weak link. (S 30 1:15-17)
  Numerous anomalies were reported:
  Palm Beach County logged 88,000 more votes than voters; 
  A Franklin County Ohio machine error gave Bush 3,893 extra votes;
  Broward County FL balloting for Amendment 4, software counted backwards
  after reaching <I>2<sup>15</sup> - 1</I>, in signed 16-bit field, in tabulating
  absentee ballots; numerous reports of screens "jumping" votes from
  Kerry to Bush; many cases of long lines and long waits only in certain
  politically skewed precincts, legitimate voters who were
  disenfranchised, special optical scan pens that were
  not capable of being tallied, and so on.  Many other problems include
  weak standards and secret system evalutions, partisan oversight, 
  inadequate funding for NIST and Election Assistance Commission,
  poor training, dirty tricks (S 30 1, elaborating on R 23 58,59);
  Better standards needed for elections (R 23 59; S 30 1; more in R 23 61)

(ftp://research.att.com/dist/mab/key_study.txt or .ps;

implications, risks, and costs of `key recovery', `key escrow', and `trusted

It has appeared in various places, including the <I>World Wide Web Journal,</I>
volume 2, issue 3, Summer 1997, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, pp 241-257.
This report was reissued in the summer of 1998 with a new preface:
"One year after the 1997 publication of the first edition of this
  report, its essential finding remains unchanged and 
  unchallenged: The deployment of key recovery systems designed to
  facilitate surreptitious government access to encrypted data and
  communications introduces substantial risks and costs.  These risks
  and costs may not be appropriate for many applications of encryption,
  and they must be more fully addressed as governments consider policies
  that would encourage ubiquitous key recovery."

<H2><A NAME="37">1.34 Calendar/Date/Clock Problems including Y2K</A></H2>
<P>..... <B>Y2K Manifestations: approaching 1/1/00</B>
<P>$rfed Many of the following Y2K problems are the result of decades of
collossal short-sightedness, in requirements specification in the first
place, as well as throughout the development process.  Note that in 1965 the
Multics development effort recognized the 35-year-away Y2K problem and
addressed it quite constructively, using a 71-bit date-time field lasting
long after Y2K.  The costs are staggering.  The lessons that should be
learned from this experience are profound.  It is not just the Y2K
remediation that is relevant - it is the entire software development
process.  [I have not even bothered to insert the new "r" descriptor in
those cases below in which faulty requirements are obviously implicated!]

<H2><A NAME="46">2.3 Pun-intended definitions</A></H2>
<P>The <I>San Jose Mercury</I> (4 Jan 2004) gave a list of the 50
best punny definitions of the year  (R 23 14).  Here are several with
computer technology relevance:
<P><I> <B><FONT SIZE=+1>&#183;</FONT></B> </I> off-shorn:  vt.  Getting cut because your job moved overseas.
     [Rainer Richter, San Jose]<BR><I> <B><FONT SIZE=+1>&#183;</FONT></B> </I> Microsofa:  n.  A piece of furniture that, while it looked fine
     in the showroom, gradually begins to dominate the living room,
     eventually forcing you to replace all the other furniture,
     including the TV, to be "compatible".  [Earl T. Cohen, Fremont]<BR><I> <B><FONT SIZE=+1>&#183;</FONT></B> </I> motherbored:  n.  In many homes, a technology discussion at dinner
     between father and the kids.  (Bruce Kerr)<BR><I> <B><FONT SIZE=+1>&#183;</FONT></B> </I> Luddate:  n.  Someone you are going out with who does not 
     understand the [Santa Clara] Valley's obsession with technology.  
     (Lisa Lawrence, Palo Alto)<BR><I> <B><FONT SIZE=+1>&#183;</FONT></B> </I> Crisco:  n.  A person who got fried by buying Cisco at $80 a share.
     (Jim Schutz)<BR>And finally, here is 
an unfortunate motto for the ages: If it is not now on the Web, it does not
  exist; what's more, it never existed.  (Too bad.  A lot of good old
  stuff gets lost and becomes totally ignored if it is not on-line.
  At least this file is accessible, even if the early SIGSOFT SEN
  items are not.) <BR><P></FONT></FONT><HR >
