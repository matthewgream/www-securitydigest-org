Subject: Tachometer error caused 2005 runway overrun

On May 18, 2005, a Jordanian Airbus A320 completed a flight (on behalf of a
Spanish charter airline) from Fuerteventura, Spain, to Leeds Bradford
Airport in England.  After landing, it decelerated normally as far as a
speed of 73 knots, but then the brakes on both sides failed almost
completely.  With runway running out and reverse thrust insufficient to
stop, the pilot steered off the runway.  At 22 knots the brakes reengaged,
and the plane stopped safely without injuries.

The accident is covered by Report 6/2007 of the UK AAIB, which is available
in PDF in sections under this page:
http://www.aaib.gov.uk/sites/aaib/publications/formal_reports/6_2007_jy_jar/jy_jar_report_sections.cfm?view=print

They say the failure was the result of "excessive wheel tachometer signal
noise, caused by a bent tachometer driveshaft on each main landing gear
assembly" combined with "inadequate fault tolerance within the brake control
system".  The tachometer is involved because that's how the Brake and
Steering Control Unit (BCSU) tells whether the plane is skidding.  But the
tire and driveshaft could resonate at about the same frequency, causing the
tachometer to produce electrical noise that in turn would cause the BCSU to
malfunction and release the brakes to prevent a skid that was not happening.

The solution was to replace the driveshaft with a stronger one (solid
instead of hollow), which would also have a different resonant frequency.

Subject: Mideast submarine cable disruptions

In what appears to separate incidents, two major submarine FO cables (FLAG
Telecom and SEA-ME-WE 4) have been cut in the Middle East.

Dubai, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Pakistan, and India are all suffering badly. There's been much
rerouting to trans-Pacific circuits.

The RISKs? Well first, in an amazing short period of time [TAT-1, the
{copper} first transatlantic telephone cable was put into service in 1956;
TAT-8, the first fiber cable was in 1988.] our civilization/economy has
become highly dependent on photons & refined beach sand.

Second RISK: While cables are relatively safe in deep water, to be useful
they must come ashore somewhere; and shallow water is where they are
vulnerable. And ships also like those same shallows.

Cables are only REALLY redundant if they have nothing in common, and for
reasons of geography, politics and history, they flock together in those
same shallow port waters.

Alexander Harrowell made a sage comment on the NANOG list.
	
  [Landing spots..] have historically been in the same strategic
  locations. Suez, Singapore, Cape Town; it's the strategic map of the
  British Empire. "Five strategic keys lock up the world", as Lord
  Fisher said. (Dover, Gibraltar, Singapore, Cape Town, and Suez).

I'm further reminded of Dan Charles' report on Relay, Maryland:
<http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1030846> where he
discussed how wagon trains, telegraph, railroads, and now fiber... all Go
West via the same route.

Subject: Empire State Building car e-interference mystery (*NY Daily News*)

In addition to some of the reported incidents, there were several incidents
in the Washington area some years ago in which digital PBXs interfered with
air traffic control at National Airport (as it was then called).

http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/01/27/2008-01-27_empire_state_building_car_zap_mystery.html

Several cars a day get bizarrely stranded in a five-block 'Bermuda Triangle'
near the Empire State Building.
http://www.nydailynews.com/img/2008/01/27/amd_valeev.jpg

In the shadow of the Empire State Building lies an "automotive Bermuda
Triangle" - a five-block radius where vehicles mysteriously die.  No one is
sure what's causing it, but all roads appear to lead to the looming giant in
our midst - specifically, its Art Deco mast and 203-foot-long, antenna-laden
spire.  "We get about 10 to 15 cars stuck near there every day," said Isaac
Leviev, manager of Citywide Towing, the AAA's exclusive roadside assistance
provider from 42nd St. to the Battery. "You pull the car four or five blocks
to the west or east and the car starts right up."

"The lights work, the horn works, everything. But it won't start," Russell
Valeev, a driver for Golden Touch Transportation said one recent evening as
he sat in his 2005 Ford van with the hood propped open on E. 35th St.,
between Lexington and Park Aves. "It's my job. No money."

The 102-story building, at Fifth Ave. between 33rd and 34th Sts., has been
home to broadcast equipment since its opening in 1931, when RCA installed an
experimental TV antenna.  Since the 9/11 attacks destroyed the twin towers,
the building has regained its status as the leading transmission site for
commercial broadcast outfits, with 13 TV and 19 FM stations mounting
antennas on its spire.

The FCC said it has not received any complaints regarding interference
affecting autos in midtown, and Empire State Building officials don't
believe the claims.  Yet some phantom transmission appears to cause the
remote keyless entry systems of scores of car owners to go haywire and stop
talking to their vehicles.  [Source: Richard Weir, Empire State Building car

Researchers at Eureka Aerospace are turning a fictional concept from the
movie *2 Fast 2 Furious* into reality: they're creating an electromagnetic
system that can quickly bring a vehicle to a stop.  The system, which can be
attached to an automobile or aircraft carrier, sends out pulses of microwave

Subject: Manufacturer Blames Bankruptcy on Failed ERP Implementation

American LaFrance (ALF), a US manufacturer of fire trucks, has blamed a
failed ERP implementation for its filing for bankruptcy this week.  Coupled
with ``inventory not properly declared as obsolete'', ALF incurred $100
million in unanticipated costs, lengthy production delays, and problems
servicing customers' existing trucks.

http://www.americanlafrance.com/interior.asp?n=22

A significant consequence to ALF's operational problems is fire departments
across North America are apparently experiencing significant delays in
obtaining spare parts and service for their front-line fire trucks, and new
orders (most of which will be replacements for aging apparatus) are being
delayed by months. This will undoubtedly result in apparatus (and possibly
the associated companies of firefighters) being placed out of service more
than usual, and/or use of older, less reliable reserve apparatus (which
typically don't meet current safety standards).

Although problems with ERP implementations have caused a number of high
profile business disruptions in recent years (eg Hersheys, HP) this is the
first I've heard of a company blaming their bankruptcy on ERP. The RISKS
involved in such large-scale IT projects are well known (especially to
readers here), but unfortunately still occur all too often.

[For the benefit of readers who aren't accountants or lawyers, Chapter 11 is
a US bankruptcy provision that allows a company to voluntarily declare
bankruptcy, prepare a financial reorganization plan under the supervision of
the bankruptcy court, and (hopefully) ultimately be discharged from
bankruptcy as a viable concern.]

Subject: 2008 meltdown margin player blames s/w for failure to complete trades

Tricom, a margin lending specialist in Australia was unable to complete its
trades, and finalize settlements. the ASX had to declare a hold on its
activities and close off the market without it.  Everything was resolved by
the next business day.

Tricom stated (according to the Australian Newspaper) that it was net
positive, but s/w let it down and it couldn't complete the volume of
processing required due to a new s/w system.
  http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,23142583-15306,00.html
suggests that the story is not that simple, the system was accepted under
the 3 day burn-in test the ASX require, and that it will not form the main
focus of any investigation.

I think we'll see quite a lot of software/computer-systems blame over
triggers to sell, but this appears to be about scaling functions to close
off, rather than automatic bet-the-market outcomes.

Interesting to think about what are the possible scaling functions in these
kinds of systems. The average-to-peak difference could be immense, if you
spread a range of people making smallish buys (by volume of event) spread
over a long time, but then have a synchronization event which forces
everyone to trigger SELL at the same time. It could be several decimal
orders of magnitude variation in the transaction volumes, which makes
capacity planning and even some data structure design quite important
methinks...

Whether electronic voting machines are under scrutiny for usability or

Continuing from the story regarding a leaking coffee area causing a power

today that a former Qantas engineer has been charged with forging a
maintenance engineer's license and maintaining jets without a license.

SMH reports that one of the aircraft he was alleged to have performed
unlicensed maintenance on was VH-OJM, the Boeing 747-438 that suffered a
power loss and made an emergency landing in Bangkok.

The risks of insufficient background checking for such high profile jobs
(i.e., of the variety of "if this is done wrong, people can die") is
obvious. One hopes Qantas revisits confirmation of correct credentials for
all its engineering staff in light of this mishap.

For those not familiar with London, there are a number of "London" airports.
London City is very central and caters for short haul, mainly business

the Western fringes of Greater London, well away from the centre.

The other London airports (Gatwick, Luton, Stansted) are tens of miles outside

"The bank cannot find out who did this because of the Data Protection Act

%T   "Software Testing Practice: Test Management"

This book is intended to assist candidates who are writing the exam for the
International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) Certified
Tester.

Chapter one stresses the importance of software and software quality, and
explains that the text is based on the ISTQB Certified Tester second
("Advanced") level, specifically the Test Manager module (excluding the
topic of reviews).  This chapter also presents an overview of the first
("Foundation") level as background.  The tools and processes used to
structure testing are outlined in chapter two.  Testing is examined, in
chapter three, in relation to the software life cycle.  Problems with
different development models are analyzed, but it is interesting that the
complexity of the models is not covered as a risk factor.  Criteria for a
testing policy are discussed in chapter four.  Chapter five mandates a
formal test plan.  The blueprint will be helpful for those who do not have a
structure in place, but appears overly committed to items that are not
inherently necessary for all trials.  Controls to ensure and follow the
progress of testing are detailed in chapter six.  Chapter seven explains
some of the common quality and process improvement models, and their
implications for testing.  Testing is used to detect faults or deviations in
software, and chapter eight looks at the classification and handling of such
issues.  Chapter nine examines risk analysis with respect to software
testing.  The material follows most standard principles for risk management,
and so is not wrong in any specifics, but the text fails to present helpful
means for using this technique to best advantage.  Various important skills
that should be contained within the test team are listed in chapter ten.
Test metrics are discussed, in chapter eleven, in an academic manner that is
very similar to the style of chapter nine.  In the same way, by attempting
to apply a single process of evaluation to all test management software
tools, the authors restrict the utility of chapter twelve.  Chapter thirteen
lists standards bodies, as well as some of the guidelines that relate to
software development and evaluation.

The book reflects the certification, and one cannot fault it for that.
However, if the authors had been willing to move beyond the overall coverage
of principles, they might have produced a more useful work.
